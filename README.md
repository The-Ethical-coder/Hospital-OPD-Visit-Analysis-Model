# Hospital-OPD-Visit-Analysis-Model
Hospital OPD Visit Analysis Model 🏥

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on hospital Outpatient Department (OPD) visit patterns. This model simulates hospital traffic and identifies daily/weekly trends to optimize staffing and reduce patient wait times.

📌 Project Overview

As part of the Minor 1 EDA submission, this project analyzes a synthetic dataset of 1,000+ hospital records to uncover:

Peak Arrival Times: Identifying rush hours (10 AM - 1 PM).

Weekly Cycles: Analyzing high-load days (Mondays) vs. low-load days (Sundays).

Departmental Efficiency: Comparing wait times across Cardiology, Pediatrics, General Medicine, and more.

🛠️ Technical Stack

Data Generation: NumPy, Random

Data Manipulation: Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
